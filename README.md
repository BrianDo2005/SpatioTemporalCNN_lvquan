# Left ventricle quantification through spatio-temporal CNNs

## Description

This code corresponds to the spatio-temporal CNN implemented through 3D convolutions described in "Left ventricle quantification through spatio-temporal CNNs. A. Debus and E. Ferrante. STACOM Workshop, MICCAI 2018."  You can download it here https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07967

The results reported in the paper were obtained for the training data provided by the LVQuan Challenge organizers (https://lvquan18.github.io/), using a 5-folds cross validation setting.
